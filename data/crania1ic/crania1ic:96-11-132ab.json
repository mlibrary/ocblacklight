    "This cranium has a loose calotte, and is microcephalic (625 cc). It is missing RP4 and LP3, and has AP short alveolar processes and clivus. The petrosals are squat and hypertrophic-looking, and are severely intruding the jugular fa. (bilateral). There is a large “step” between the pituitary fossa and lesser wings (cf. #125 through the latter is more severe). The occipital condyles are divided into anterior and posterior halves by a sulcus. The left sphenoid spine is prominent and flat, and there is extremely thin bone on the floor of TMJ. The spheno-occipital synchondrosis is unfused. Additionally, the M3s are still in their crypts. The mandible associated with this cranium (b) is missing I1s and LC. The LP4 alveolus is resorbed so that M1 contacts LP3. This mandible has a very short corpus. There is severe linear enamel hypoplasia on the premolars, viz. RP4, and the MP3s are still in their crypts."
