  "dc:description": [
    "This cranium has a missing calotte, and is missing most teeth and much of the posterior palate, viz. left. The incisor and left premolar and molar have been resorbed. The left pterygoid plates are atrophied. It is a little unclear exactly what the pathology is here. A calotte was placed with this cranium, but does not appear to be correctly matched."
