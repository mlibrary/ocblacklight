  "dc:description": [
    "Cranium has a highly worn RP4 and LM1, and there is resorption of molar and premolar alveoli. Overall the cranium is very light-weight due to bone loss: the superior bony vault is visibly smoothed (\"eroded\"), and the right temporal squama, palatines, and orbital plates are paper-thin. The pterygoid plates may have contacted the posterior sphenoid or petrosals. Palatine foramina are expanded, and the vault is grossly asymmetrical."
