    "All teeth have been lost to resorption, as far as the incisive canal. The metopic suture meets coronal to the right of the sagittal suture, and there are two wormian bones in the sagittal suture. There are also two wormian bones to the left in the lambdoidal suture, and three wormian bones to the right. There is complex wormiation at each parietal notch, as well. The vault bone is extremely thin (transparent) at the middle miningeal arteries and some arachnoid foveae along the sagittal suture."
