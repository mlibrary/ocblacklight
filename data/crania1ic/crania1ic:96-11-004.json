    "Craniumâ€™s zygomatics are broken and have been glued back on, many left teeth are present but some are broken. The dorsum sellae broken or resorbed, the left foramen ovale is enlarged while right f. ovale is bipartite, foramina spinosa not fully closed but open onto petrosals, deep digastric grooves create mitten-shaped mastoids, condylar foramen is present on the left side only, occiput is asymmetrically protuberant (toward left), there is healed blunt-force-trauma on the anteromedial corner of left parietal, there are bony growths off petrosals intruding into the sigmoid sinuses, minor osteophytes on the endocranial occipital and ectocranial frontal, hypoglossal canals are completely (left) and partially (right) bifurcated, and each orbital surface of the sphenoid greater-wings has a small, bony plate at the medial base of the optic fissure."
