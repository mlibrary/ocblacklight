    "Cranium is missing all teeth. On the right side, there are two supraoribtal foramina, and on the left there is a notch and foramen. There are abscesses about the molars. Temporal spines are prominent (eustachian-process-like). The median nuchal line is sharply excavated laterally just posterior to foramen magnum. The (broken) right lateral pterygoid plate is posteriorly extended, almost creating an accessory (‘pterygospinous’) foramen immediately medial to f. ovale. There are large auditory exostoses in the right external auditory meatus."
