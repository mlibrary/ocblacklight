    "Cranium retains RC, RM3, and LM1-3. The loose calotte is wired on, and the left zygomatic arch is broken. There is extensive alveolar remodeling (viz. around the molars). Vault bone is very thick and heavy. The  lateral pterygoid plates nearly contact the sphenoid spines, almost creating pterygospinous foramina (bilaterally).  The spheno-occipital synchondrosis is only partially fused. The left hypoglossal canal is bifid, and deep canals course between the occipital condyles and jugular foramina. There is mild arthritis of the temporomandibular joints. The sagittal suture is completely obliterated. The glabellar region is prominent. LM3 is abscessed buccally."
