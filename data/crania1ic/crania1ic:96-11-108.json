  "dc:description": [
    "This is a cranium, missing the calotte and all teeth except for LM3. There is possible healed blunt force trauma along the medial right supraorbital, and as a result, the left supraorbital projects somewhat more and shows greater sinus. The hypoglossal canals are bifurcated (bilateral), and there is a full and low pterygo-spinous foramen on the right. There is also a large, but incomplete, pterygo-spinous process on the right. The LC-M2 alveoli are resorbed, and there is a silver filling on the occlusal LM3. The root of RM2 is abscessed, and the RM2-3 alveoli are resorbed. There are osteophytes on the superomedial orbital corners, where the trochlea inserts (bilateral). Additionally, there is petrosal intrusion into the sigmoid sinuses (bilateral)."
