    "Cranium retains many teeth but many are broken, the sectioned calotte is glued back on, and much of the left infraorbital surface is missing. The RM1 and LP3-4 alveoli are resorbed, many molars have silver fillings, and there is a caries on distal RP3. The sagittal and lambdoidal sutures are obliterating."
