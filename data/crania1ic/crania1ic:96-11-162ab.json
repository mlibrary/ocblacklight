    "This cranium is microcephalic (diminutive), or may just be very small. It retains RP4-M2 and LM2. There is resorption of the LI1, LP4-M1, and RM3 alveoli, as well as an abscess of the LM3 alveolus. The mesial surface of RP4 has large caries, and overall the teeth are highly worn. There is a healing fracture of the nasal bones and right maxilla. The left hypoglossal canal is bridged and/or bifid. Additionally, the left parietal and occipital portions of the vault protrude a bit more than the right side, and the major vault sutures are beginning to be obliterated (viz. sagittal). The mandible (b) associated with this cranium has a broken right condyle, with all teeth missing and all alveoli resorbed."
