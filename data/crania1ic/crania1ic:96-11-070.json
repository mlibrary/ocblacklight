    "This cranium is badly weathered, the left zygomatic arch is broken, and only the right and left M1-2 are present.  It appears artificially deformed by anteroposterior compression. The right parietal and occipital protrudes posterolaterally more than the left. The metopic suture is completely preserved. The orbits display extensive cribra orbitalia. The tympanic plates each have hole, and the bilateral expression suggests not it is not due to weathering. The right jugular foramen greatly is expanded, and there are some wormians on lambdoid suture and around asterion."
