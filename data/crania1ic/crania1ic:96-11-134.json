    "This cranium is brachycephalic, as it is artificially deformed by anterio-posteriorally directed compression. Most teeth are present, but some are broken. The LM2-3 alveoli are present, but there is an abscess at the RP3 alveolus. Additionally, there is resorption of the LP3 root and LP4-M2 alveoli. The infratemporal crests are ML oblong (bilateral). There is very thin, transparent-like bone on the floor of the left TMJ, and a lesion or hole on the tympanic plates superior to the vaginal processes (bilateral). There are wormian bones at lambda (bilateral). The zygomaticsâ€™ frontal processes are ML broad, and bilateral; they are probably related to the anterior-posterioral compression. Osteophytes intrude into the right hypoglossal canal. There are bony spicules on the basiocciput, and zygomatic tubercles/massetric scars cleft at suture."
