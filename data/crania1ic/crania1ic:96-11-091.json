    "Craniumâ€™s alveoli are resorbed. There are healed nasal bone fractures. The flat right supraorbital costa suggests an additional healed fracture. There is extensive bony spotty deposition across vault. The supraorbital/glabella region is massively developed. The coronal suture is obliterated by posterior-ward deposition from the frontal bone.  Bregma is porous and resorptive. The left dorsum sellae is connected with the left petrosal by a flat stretch of bone."
