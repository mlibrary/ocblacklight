    "Cranium (a) is missing all teeth, and the calotte is loose. Most alveoli are resorbed. There is a healed fracture through left pterion and onto the temporal squama. The left squamosal suture continues posteriorly down the length of the mastoid, and the right lambdoid suture continues to tip of mastoid. There is an osteophytic knob inferior to the superior nuchal line, and one on the left parietal near the sagittal suture. The left jugular foramen is bifurcated (by occipital and temporal contributions). Pitted lesion endocranially mark the left sphenoid greater wing. Temporo-occipital sutures endocranially are slightly open around the sigmoid sinuses. At lambda there are remnants of a wormian bone suture, and there is an extrasutural bone at right pterion. Mandible (b) is missing all teeth. Most alveoli are resorbed, and the coronoid processes are irregularly-contoured."
