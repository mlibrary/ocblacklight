  "dc:description": [
    "Cranium (a) belongs to an individual with achondroplasia. All alveoli are resorbed, and vault bone is very thick. There are osteophytes on the endocranial frontal squama, left foramen ovale, endocranial basiocciput, and groove for medulla oblongata. Bony growths from the petrosals intrude over jugular foramina. There is mild pitting at the anterolateral corner of middle cranial fossa. A wormian bone sits at lambda, and one in the left coronal suture. Styloid processes are atrophied. Bone of infraorbital surface is very thin, and there is a hole on the right exposing the maxillary sinus. Bony spines on the inferior greater wings of sphenoids jut into the inferior orbital fissures. Massetric tubercles are exaggerated and rugose. Abnormalities associated with the pituitary gland include: bony growths on anterior sella turcica/pituitary fossa and anterior clinoid processes, and remodeling of the dorsum sellae. Mandible (b) is missing all teeth due to alveolar resorption."
