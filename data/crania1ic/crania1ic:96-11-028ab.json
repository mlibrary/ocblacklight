    "Cranium (a) has an empty RP4 alveolus and a loose calotte. Individual suffered from osteitis deformans (Paget's disease). The LI1-2 and RI1 alveoli are resorbed, and most teeth worn down to rounded peg-like structures.  Postglenoid processes are prominent, there are bilateral rugosities at posterolateral maxillary hard palate, and the spheno-occipital synchondrosis is unfused or broken. There is a  tubercle at basion, resorption of the iniac region, doubled right supraorbital foramina. Hypertrophied facial bone 'bridges' the over routes of the left supratrochlear and infraorbital vessels (probably related to osteitis). The right mastoid foramen is enlarged. Mandible (b) with most lower teeth present"
