  "dc:description": [
    "Cranium preserves most teeth, though many are broken, and the calotte is loose. The facial skeleton is badly broken so that the left half barely held on at the fronto-zygomatic suture. The nasal bones may be malformed, but it is difficult to tell due to breakage. Superciliary arches/glabella are prominent. Large mastoid foramina open as large holes at the superior sigmoid sinuses. The occiput is protuberant and the supramastoid crests pronounced."
