    "The cranium is badly weathered, viz. on the right, and preserves only the LM3. Alveoli are resorbed, there is a lesion on the right frontal bone, and a wormian bone in the sagittal suture just anterior to lambda. The left nasal bone arcs to the right distally, internasal suture deviates to right proximally."
