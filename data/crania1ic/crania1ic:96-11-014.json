    "Cranium missing all teeth. There is a huge, partially-healed hole (allegedly from surgery) on the left parietal, and a healed fracture line radiating anteromedially from the hole. The metopic suture is completely preserved. There is alveolar resorption, and abscessing at the left M1-2. The vomeral perpendicular plate is ‘doubled’ anteriorly, and the inferolateral margins of the nasal aperture are grooved. The left hypoglossal canal is bifid, and the left jugular foramen is nearly bifid. The massetric tubercles are notched at zygomaxillare inferior, and there is a small lesion on facial surface of the right inferomedial orbital margin"
