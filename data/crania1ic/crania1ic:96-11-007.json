  "dc:description": [
    "Cranium retains most teeth. There is bony growth endocranially (sometimes obliterating vessels), a wormian bone at right and left asterion. There is extreme dental crowding, and the right jugular foramen is enlarged (viz. occipital). The left lacrimal duct (viz. ethmoid) is also enlarged. A bulbous osteophyte is at intersection of intermaxillary/palatine sutures. The cranial vault is thick and dense (little/no diploe), the coronal and sagittal sutures are starting to obliterate, and the dorsum sellae is either missing either due to resorption or post-mortem breakage. There is calculus about the molars, and the M1s display a pronounced Carabelliâ€™s cusp."
