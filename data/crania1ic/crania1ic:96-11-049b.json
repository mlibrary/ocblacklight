    "Mandible retains most teeth. LM1-2 and RP4-M2 alveoli are resorbed, and there are silver fillings in the molars and premolars. There is a pronounced and singular mental spine and an osteophytic knob just labial to RM2/3. Mild dental wear with less alveolar resorption, plus poor 'occlusal' fit, suggest the not associated with the 49a cranium."
