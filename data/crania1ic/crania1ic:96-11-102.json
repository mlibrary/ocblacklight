  "dc:description": [
    "The calotte is missing. While most teeth are present, they consist mostly of broken crowns and roots. There is a healed fracture of the nasal bones and right maxilla. There is calculus on the buccal and occlusal faces of the RM1-2 crowns and mild RM1-2 alveolar resorption. The left styloid process may be atrophied, and there is a deeply excavated tract for the left supraorbital art/vein. There is a notch medially of the occipital condyle (bilateral). Additionally, this skull almost has a left pterygospinous fossa."
