    "Cranium (a) retains LP3-M1, RI2-C roots, and RP3-4 (LP3 and LM1 are loose). Molar alveoli are variously resorbed, broken, and abscessed. The left pterygoid plate contacts posterior sphenoid creating a pterygoid foramen just inferior to f. ovale. The nasal bones are diminutive. The superior-most tympanic is unfused to the temporomandibular joint bilaterally. Mandible (b) preserves parts of LI2-P4, but only the LP3 is complete. LM2-3 and RP4-M2 and part of RM3 alveoli are resorbed, and the mental spines are pronounced."
