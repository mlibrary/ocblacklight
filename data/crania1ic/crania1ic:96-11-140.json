  "dc:description": [
    "This is the cranium of a juvenile. It is missing the nasal bones. The cranium retains rdc-dm2 and has unerupted right and left I1-2 and M1-2 crowns, visible in crypts. The sagittal suture deviates to the left anteriorly. There is modest carabelliâ€™s expression on the dm2s and M1s. The occipital and parietal bones are depressed centered at lambda. The right posterior vault protrudes a bit more than the left, and there is vault-face asymmetry. The left temporal foramen or fossa is more circular than the right. Overall, the cranium looks fairly brachycephalic, possibly indicating artificial modification."
