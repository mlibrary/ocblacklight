    "Rim and neck broken off, leaving very small round opening to body.  Neck must have been narrow.  Body is bulbous, with concentric ridges on shoulder, broadly convex sides.  Four vertical dents extend from concave body to 1/3 of way up sides, yielding a puckered effect on bottom.  Orange clay, with bottom half darkened slightly from firing."
