    "Fragment of woven fabric with 2-ply linen warp and bands of yellow, medium brown and dark brown weft.   Another piece of the same fabric has been sewn on (13 cm x 3 cm).   Both pieces have plain selvedges along the seam edge, although the selvedge of the smaller piece is very deteriorated.  As well as the two shades of brown and the yellow weft, this smaller piece has blue and purple wefts.  Patterning on both pieces was made with linen weft-wrapping."
