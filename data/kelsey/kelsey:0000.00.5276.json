  "dc:description": [
    "The clear glass vessel has a cylindrical body with wheel-incised designs in two horizontal bands, divided by an incised groove around the middle.  The body stands on a slightly stemmed base, which is ground flat for stability.  The neck of the bottle is irregularly chipped and broken, so shape of rim is not apparent.  The fabric is transparent and shows little weathering; only the base has slight traces of pitting, in the groove of a large chip.    Free blown and cut of transparent colorless glass."
