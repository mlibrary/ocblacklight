    "Fragment of woven fabric with thick 2-ply linen warp and several weft bands using medium brown, brown/gold and green/blue.  Linen weft-wrapping has been used in most of the bands to form patterns.  One edge may have been a selvedge.  Some wefts wrap completely around the end warp, but many wefts are missing.  Some of the linen weft-wrapping yarn ends were not woven in on one side."
