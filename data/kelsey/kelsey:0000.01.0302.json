    "Fragment of woven fabric with plied linen warp, remnants of linen weft wrapping and several colors of wool weft in bands as follows:",
    "dark brown                        2 picks",
    "medium brown                 2 or 3 picks",
    "variegated blue/green    4.5 cm",
    "red                                      1 cm",
    "variegated brown             1.5 cm",
    "purple/red                        0.7 cm",

    "brown                                 5.5 cm",
    "Remnants of linen patterning (weft wrapping) appear throughout the fragment.  The linen is very deteriorated but seems to be a roughly checkerboard pattern from the purple/red band to the 4.5 cm blue/green band.  In the 5.5 cm wide brown band, the linen weft wrapping forms a semi circle near the edge, with the remainder of linen patterning too deteriorated to describe."
