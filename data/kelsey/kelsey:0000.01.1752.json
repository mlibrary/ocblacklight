    "Large fragment of multi-colored woven wool fabric.  The warp is 2-ply unevenly dyed green.  The main weft is 4-ply unevenly dyed green.  There is a supplementary weft that may have been used for tufts (or loops).  These supplementary wefts are in four colors; red, yellow/green, light brown/gold and dark brown/red.  The yellow/green may be a natural yarn with green dye that has bled into it.  There are several random stitches of coarse linen yarn.  A thinner linen yarn was used to attach two small fragments of brown woven wool fabric.  The larger fragment has purple bands and tapestry patterning as follows:",
    "purple band               0.3 cm",
    "brown                         0.7 cm",
