    "The first pyramid, Cheops, and the Nile valley. The pyramid is at the left of the view. To the right of pyramid, in eleven inches from the left edge, is the head only of Sphinx-- the body is too low down to be seen from this point. A small cemetery is near the central foreground. Beyond is the flat expanse of the Nile valley. At the right third of the picture, in the far distance, is the faint line of the Mokattam Hills bounding the Nile valley on the east at this point. This shows well how the pyramids are on a natural limestone platform considerably above the Nile Valley. Size, 9 1/2 x 32 in.",
