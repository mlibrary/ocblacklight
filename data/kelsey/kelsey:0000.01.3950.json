    "Fragment of yellowed woven wool fabric with remnants of three blue tapestry bands.  The center band is 1.5 cm wide, the two other bands are 1.7 cm wide each.  Each band widens in the center.  Due to stitching and damage, accurate measurement is not possible.  There are remnants of linen slit tapestry pattern elements in the wider sections.  There are rows of sewing as well as a section of repair stitching (darning) through the tapestry bands."
