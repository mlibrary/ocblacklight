    "Jiang Qing’s leading role in producing proletarian revolutionary performing arts （1964-1967) is acknowledge and artistic efforts in transforming performing arts are identified as the inception of the Cultural Revolution. The figures surrounding the central figure-Jiang Qing- are mostly characters from the model Peking operas and ballets. The two figures on the far left side represent famous cultural products in the Yan’an period, suggesting continuity between the two periods in terms of creating proletarian culture. The female peasant and male factory worker on each side of the top corner and the old Uygur man in the lower left corner represent the CCP’s policy of cultural representation that centers on workers, peasants, women and ethnic minority."
