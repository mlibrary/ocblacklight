    "“Destroying the four olds”, that is, the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes, was a call issued by Lin Biao on August 18, 1966 when he accompanied Mao on the Tiananmen Rostrum at the first students rally. The characters on the flag with Mao’s image read, “Rebellion is justified.”"
